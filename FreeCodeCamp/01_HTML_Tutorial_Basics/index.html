        <h2>Who is Esquitx and Stormy?</h2> 
        <p> 
            Esquitx and Stormy are two incredible dogs who have brought endless joy to my life. Their personalities are as different as night and day, and they never fail to keep me on my toes.

        <p> 
            Esquitx, my loyal little angel, is a mix between a Black Labrador and an American Staffordshire Terrier. He's been by my side since I was 12 years old, and our bond has only grown stronger over the years.

            Stormy it's the the gorgeous Bordercollie and the pet of my girlfriend, and since 10 months ago he is being part of my life and i can not be more happy about that.
